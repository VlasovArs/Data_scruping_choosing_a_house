# Data_scruping_choosing_a_house
What the client asked for:
I need someone to parse this page into a spreadsheet:

https://citydev-portal.edinburgh.gov.uk/idoxpa-web/search.do?action=simple&searchType=Application

Search by 3 terms

'FULSTL'
'CLESTL'
'Short term'

There will be about 500 results in total. I want them to be in a spreadsheet with:

- A header with a link
- Link
- Address
- Checked
- Status
- Links to all documents, with the document type, for example, "Notification of the decision".

Ideally, this would be a script that I can run at any time.

What I did:

I have parsed data on 3 topics, you can see the election result in the "House.csv" file

Result:

The order was completed, all the conditions were met.
